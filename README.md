Hello! My name is Sourangshu Ghosh. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the **Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore**. I am doing research in Interfacial Contact Mechanics.

Prior to my doctoral studies in IISc Bangalore, I was a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant in the **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**. I was actively involved in research focusing on wildfire propagation and its impact on critical infrastructure. I developed models to predict wildfire behavior and assess potential damage to infrastructure. These models aim to provide real-time predictions to aid in resource management and enhance community resilience against wildfires.

Earlier, I completed a dual degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Civil Engineering at the **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, with a minor in Mathematics and Computing. During my time there, I engaged in various research projects, particularly in structural engineering and applied mathematics. My interests included deep learning, discrete mathematics, number theory, and stochastic modeling.

## **My Research Works and Interests**

All of my works are basically scientific computing projects. I mostly interested in application of various Stochastic and Probabilistic Methods/Models in Real Life Problems. Apart from that I have also good knowledge in the field of Evolutionary Algorithms and its recent incorporation in Various Machine Learning Algorithms. I mostly do my coding works in Fortran, C/C++/MATLAB and Python. All of my codes are uploaded as Github Repositories.
