Hello! My name is Sourangshu Ghosh. I am a fourth year undergraduate student of the department of civil engineering enrolled in its Dual Degree Program in **Indian institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, India** mostly knows to all as IIT KGP. I am also doing my minors in Mathematics and Computing in its Master of Science program. Apart from these I have been working under various professors of my university in various research projects. I have been mostly collaborating in my research works with Dr. Baidurya Bhattacharya, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT KGP.

## **My Research Works and Interests**

All of my works are basically scientific computing projects. I mostly interested in application of various Stochastic and Probabilistic Methods/Models in Real Life Problems. Apart from that I have also good knowledge in the field of Evolutionary Algorithms and its recent incorporation in Various Machine Learning Algorithms. I mostly do my coding works in Fortran, C/C++/MATLAB and Python. All of my codes are uploaded as Github Repositories. My Github Profile can be seen by clicking here [https://github.com/SourangshuGhosh](https://github.com/SourangshuGhosh) . This website contains all the links to the various repositories/topics and explains how it works and what they are meant for
